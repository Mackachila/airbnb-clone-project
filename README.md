## 🧱 Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields:

#### 1. **User**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (guest, host, admin)

#### 2. **Property**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to User)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

#### 3. **Booking**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Property)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `status`

#### 4. **Review**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### 5. **Payment**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key)
- `amount`
- `payment_status`
- `payment_date`

### Relationships:
- A **user** can have multiple **properties**.
- A **property** can have many **bookings** and **reviews**.
- A **booking** is linked to one **user**, one **property**, and one **payment**.
- A **review** is associated with a specific **user** and **property**.

## ⚙️ Feature Breakdown

### 🧑‍💼 User Management
Allows users to register, log in securely, manage their profile, and authenticate sessions using JWT tokens.

### 🏡 Property Management
Hosts can list their properties by entering descriptions, pricing, and images. Properties can be edited or removed as needed.

### 📅 Booking System
Users can search and book available properties for specific dates. Booking data is stored and visible to users and property owners.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Stripe is used to securely process payments for bookings, with proper handling of payment success or failure states.

### ⭐ Review System
Guests can leave reviews and star ratings for properties they have stayed in. Helps improve transparency and trust.

### 📊 Data Optimization
Efficient schema design, indexing, and caching strategies ensure the application performs well even with a large dataset.

## 🔒 API Security

### Key Security Measures:
- **Authentication:** JWT-based login system ensures only valid users can access protected endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access controls to differentiate between guests, hosts, and admins.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF by validating and sanitizing input.
- **Secure Payments:** All payment operations are done through secure APIs provided by Stripe.

### Why Security Matters:
- Protecting **user data** (emails, passwords, bookings).
- Ensuring only authorized users can **access or modify listings**.
- Securing **payment details** to prevent fraud or leaks.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring faster delivery and higher code quality.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates running tests, builds, and deployments on each push or pull request.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- **Heroku / Vercel / AWS:** Platforms for deploying the web app with version control and rollback features.
